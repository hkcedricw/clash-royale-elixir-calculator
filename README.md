## What is this
This is a React app which helps you on the game "Clash Royale".<br />

If you have ever played the game, you know how important it is to have an idea about how many elixirs your components have. That's why we have this React app.<br />

This is an elixir calculator which follows the rule on how elixirs are consumed / increased during the game. Just a bit in a manual way that you have to tell the app when your component deploys troops. Sound like useless? I assume you still want it in case you have friends sitting together with you and he can help providing you the information.<br />

Apart from the fun gaming part, this is also a demonstration on how a React app runs together with Redux Store. Although Redux may not be a must for this app. Here we can easily see how we apply Action Dispatch, State Reduce, and reflects it through presentation and container component.<br />

Enzyme is also used here for a simple testing components, showing the basics of how it works with React component testing.<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, after running `npm install` you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
